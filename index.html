    <h2>About Maka</h2>
    <p>
      I've always loved creating beautiful things - pictures, videos, reels, stories... 
      I've always felt very connected to the technical side of this field. 
      I was never afraid of exploring and using new programs. 
      I believe I have a unique perspective and ability to visualize ideas in my own way. 
      My husband, children, sisters, and friends all noticed this. They often told me that 
      this field was truly where I belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began learning how to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools with the goal of 
      applying this knowledge in practice. The more I studied, the more I believed this was my path. 
      The learning process was very enjoyable because I knew it was bringing me closer to my goal.
      I learned quickly and took great pleasure in the results of my dedicated work.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's how the idea to create my own page was born - “𝙇𝙤𝙜𝙤𝙇𝙖𝙗 𝘽𝙮 𝙈𝙖𝙠𝙖 / Maka's Design Studio.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A space where I can offer you logos, branding elements, and other design products
      - all created with heart and taste - that will make your business or project stand out.
      This is my new venture, created with love and hard work.
      The best is yet to come!

  <h2>Portfolio</h2>
  <p>Here are some of Maka's recent designs:</p>
  <div class="portfolio-grid">
  <div class="portfolio-item">
     <img src="assets/images/cherry.jpg" alt="1" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="100">
     <p>Cherry — a cozy and tasteful space for handmade items!
I am delighted to present the logo I created.
In the design, I tried to convey the brand's joy, purity, and natural charm—exactly
 like every handmade item from Cherry.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="portfolio-item">
     <img src="assets/images/Solo Studio V3.png" alt="2" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="100">
     <p>This was not just an ordinary order; it was a journey, where I paid special attention to every detail.
 I poured my whole heart and soul into this logo because I knew it had to be as pure and innocent as children.
 I thought carefully about the colors, the font, the concept, and how the magical and fairy-tale world of children 
 could be conveyed through the camera.</p>
</div>
<div class="portfolio-item">
     <img src="assets/images/3.jpg" alt="3" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="100">
     <p>I created this logo for someone who is not only an outstanding photographer but also the most important person in my life—my spouse.
Their vision, warmth, and professionalism can be felt in every frame they capture.
The sunrise in the logo is not accidental; it symbolizes the beginning of a new stage and new opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="portfolio-item">
     <img src="assets/images/თომას ქოხი.png" alt="4" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="100">
     <p>It is happiness when the visual style perfectly fits the brand's character.
This logo is a combination of nature and coziness.</p>
